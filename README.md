What is `stb_manipulation`?
--------

A take on understanding how parsing image files works and organizing them into data structures. This is not a standalone project and is to be used for another project doing something with images. Bascially image manipulation but in a lower-level (Handling directly with bits).

The main premise is to break down `stbi_load` and its underlying infrastructure that processes the images and returns `stbi_uc*`.
